## ⚠️ The Problem
The report system in Dota 2 is **deeply flawed**. It's often used as a rage button rather than a tool for justice. 😡

This project was created in an effort to **better understand the psychology behind player's reports**. We want to know *exactly* what triggers a report in the heat of the moment.

I am very interested to see what other people learn! 🧐 This tool helps you efficiently acquire **hard-evidence** for why the system doesn't really work as intended.

## ✨ Features

*   **See "Invisible" Reports** 👀: We detect exactly when a player opens the scoreboard and clicks the report button.
*   **Beautiful GUI** 🖥️: No complex commands, just a nice web interface.
*   **Auto-Download** 📥: Automatically fetch your recent matches to analyze.
*   **Deep Insights** 📊: See who reported whom, when, and confirmed vs. unconfirmed reports.
